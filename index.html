			<h2>About Me</h2>

					<img id = profile_pic src= "assets\images\image_tara.PNG">

					<p>I currently work at Northwestern University as a research coordinator for projects that teach parents strategies to help their language-delayed children learn to communicate better. I have a passion for translational research - research in which the findings have direct, applicable outcomes for people. I am especially interested in programming as a means to improve data management, allow us to analyze data in novel and unique ways, and creating interfaces that engage families and young children. </p>

					<p>I'm an avid online poker player; Hold 'Em and Omaha High-Low are my favorites. I love to cook and bake - it is my (highly convenient) stress-reliever after a long day. Homemade toffee with dark chocolate and peanuts has been my latest creation in the kitchen.  </p>
