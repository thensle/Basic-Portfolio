		<h2>Tara Hensle</h2>

			<section ><p>I currently work at Northwestern University as a research coordinator for projects that teach parents specific strategies to help their language-delayed children learn to communicate better. The projects I have been a part of have included children with hearing loss and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). I have a passion for translational research - research in which the findings have direct, applicable outcomes for people. Nothing turns me off more than white-lab-coat, stuffy research! I am interested in programming as a means to improve data management, programming that allows us to analyze data in novel and unique ways, and creating interfaces that engage families and young children. </p>

			<p>I love to cook and bake; it is my therapy! Homemade toffee with dark chocolate and peanuts has been my latest creation in the kitchen.  </p></section>
